Possible Erorrs you can come across while running CASAVA are:

1) Run Number:

   Usually after configuring bcl to fastq using  configureBcltofastq.pl, this inturn depends on demultiplexBcls program for converting bcl to fastq.
   if the run number is predicted as 0000 (or all zeros), this cause demultiplexBcls to exit. so change the run number to any number in Makefile.
   This run number is reflected in Reads name.
