Integrity Check for Fastq files after converting from bcl2fastq using Casava1.8.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fastq files generated by Casava1.8.2 can be found in Project_FC folder in bcl2Fastq program, they are outputted as gzip files. 


To counter check the integrity of these:


1. If paired-end, check for same no of records in both fastq files of each lane.
2. compress them back using tar, may be according to lanes/samples. 
3. filter reads that pass filtering using fastq_illumina_filter. (see illumina_filter.sh in mel-rnaseq/PreProcessing)
4. Do Quality Contorl Analysis using FastQC. (see run_fastqc.sh in mel-rnaseq/PreProcessing)
4. Backup them at acrc server.
