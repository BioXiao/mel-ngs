      3) Butterfly.
    
It also implement some pre-inchworm steps to cruch the input files for inchworm saving some time.

1) pre_inchworm.pl : For pre inchworm steps like converting fastq into fasta and concatenating them.
2) inchworm.pl     : inchowrm step.
3) chrysalis.pl    : Chrysalis step.
   chrysalis alone contains three serial steps, in which first two steps are ran serially and last one can be run in parralel.
   These three steps can also run individually, else can use above wrapper script (chrysalis.pl), which runs first two steps together.
