This gives information on existing alignment tools and downstream pipelines:



Bowtie Aligner:
---------------

Bowtie: Aligning Reads to Genome


Tophat-Cufflinks Pipeline:
--------------------------

Tophat     :  For Reads Alignment(using bowtie), and Splicing analysis
Cufflinks  :  For Transcript abundance calculation

Steps: 
 
  1) Run Tophat: Aligning reads to genome/trascriptome.
		 Junction Reads
