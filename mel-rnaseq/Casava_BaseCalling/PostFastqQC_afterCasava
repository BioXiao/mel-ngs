----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fastq files generated by Casava1.8.2 can be found in Project_FC folder in bcl2Fastq program, they are outputted as gzip files. 


To counter check the integrity of these:


1. Decompress them Using gunzip.
2. If paired-end, check for same no of records in both fastq files of each lane.
3. Chek whether each fastq record is in correct format.
4. compress them back using tar, may be according to lanes/samples. 
5. Backup them at acrc server.
