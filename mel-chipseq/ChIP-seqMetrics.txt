Evaluating ChIP-seq data:
------------------------------------

1) Number uniquely mapped reads 10M
 	In sam file, tag NH:i:1 provides the information.
        If ran bowtie with -m 1 option, use "bamtools filter -isMapped" for report only mapped reads.

2) Non redundant fraction(NRF) 0.8
	NRF = (No of positions in genome that uniquely mapped reads map to) / (Total no of uniquely mapped reads * Read length)
	It is similar to a recently published redundancy metric (Heinz et al 2010).

        NRF = (No of Uniqurly mapped reads that share different mapping location)/Total No of Uniquely mapped reads
       
3) Number of peaks called by peak finding algorithms (MACS)

4) Cross correlation (NSC) (RSC) from phantompeakqualtools package

5) Fraction of reads in peak (FrIP) (1%)

6) IDR from phantompeakqualtools package, if you have replicated in your experiment.
